# Alexa Sure-Pet

This is a template alexa skill that you can integrate your surepet catflap with.

## Installation

To use this you must first have a developer alexa account, which you can create via the alexa skills console.

## Usage

You need to copy both the interaction model as this handles the invocations and sets out the definition of the skill, you then need to copy the lambda code as this contains business logic.
